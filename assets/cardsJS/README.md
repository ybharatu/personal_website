# cardsJS

[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/richardschneider/cardsJS.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/richardschneider/cardsJS)
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/cardsJS.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/cardsJS) 

Showing playing cards that are scalable in a browser is possible with cardJS.  See the [web site](http://richardschneider.github.io/cardsJS) for some examples and the [wiki](https://github.com/richardschneider/cardsJS/wiki) for documentation.

I'm using the [Vectorized Playing Cards 1.3](http://code.google.com/p/vectorized-playing-cards/) designed by Chris Aguilar, see the [readme file](cards/readme.txt) for the details. The original SVGs are changed to *not* render in an A4 page, but to fit to size.

The [change log](https://github.com/richardschneider/cardsJS/releases) is automatically produced with
the help of [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release).

## Getting started

**cardsJS** is available for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and most modern browsers.  Test it in your currrent browser 
with the [online fiddler](http://richardschneider.github.io/cardsJS/fiddle.html).

Install with [npm](http://blog.npmjs.org/post/85484771375/how-to-install-npm)

    > npm install cardsJS --save


### Browser

Include the package from the [unpkg CDN](https://unpkg.com)

````html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://unpkg.com/cardsJS/dist/cards.min.css" />

<script src="https://unpkg.com/cardsJS/dist/cards.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
````

## Cards

Use the `<img class='card' src='cards/id.svg'>` HTML tag; where *id* is the identifier of the card.  The *id* is composed of the rank and then the suit of the card,
e.g. 'KS' is the [King of spades](https://rawgit.com/richardschneider/cardsJS/master/cards/KS.svg).
The suits are 'S', 'H', 'D' and 'C' for spades, hearts, diamonds and clubs. The rank '10' of a suit *x* is either '10*x*' or 'T*x*'.

    The king of spades is rendered as <img class='card' src='cards/KS.svg'>.

## Hands

Cards can be grouped into a hand.  A hand is a `<div class='hand'>` containing the card(s).
With an active hand, `<div class='hand active-hand'>`, moving the mouse over a `card` will move it veritically/horizontally
to indicate that the card will be selected.

    <div class="hand hhand-compact active-hand">
        <img class='card' src='cards/AS.svg'>
        <img class='card' src='cards/KS.svg'>
        <img class='card' src='cards/QS.svg'>
        <img class='card' src='cards/JS.svg'>
        <img class='card' src='cards/10S.svg'>
        <img class='card' src='cards/9H.svg'>
        <img class='card' src='cards/3H.svg'>
    </div>

A hand can also be declared with the `data-hand` attribute, see [Controlling the hand](https://github.com/richardschneider/cardsJS/wiki/Controlling-the-hand)
for more details. Also see [Controlling the fan](https://github.com/richardschneider/cardsJS/wiki/Controlling-the-fan)

    <div class="hand active-hand"
         data-hand="flow: horizontal; cards: AS,KS,QS,JS,10S,9H,3H">
    </div>
